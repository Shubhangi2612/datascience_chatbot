You:hi
Robo:Good to see you again
You:what is cross entropy?
Robo:Sorry I am still learning. Please elaborate or ask other Question!
You:what is log loss?
Robo:In classification techniques,  instead of predicting the actual classes, a measure called as LogLoss is used to predict the probabilities for an observation.
You:yes
Robo:Good to know that
You:what is bayes' theorem?
Robo:Bayes Theorem finds the probability of an event occurring given the probability of another event that has already occurred. Mathematically it is given as P(A|B) = [P(B|A)P(A)]/P(B) where A & B are events.  P(A|B) called Posterior Probability is the probability of event A(response) given that B(independent) has already occurred. P(B|A) is the likelihood of the training data i.e., probability of event B(independent) given that A(response) has already occurred. P(A) is the probability of the response variable and P(B) is the probability of the training data or evidence.

You:why is svm called as a black box technique?
Robo:SVM is termed as a black box technique, as internally the algorithm applies complex transformations on the input variables based on the Kernel trick applied. Although, the math of these tranformations is not hidden but slightly complex. Becasue of this complexity, SVM is known as a black box technique.
You:no

You:what is a neural network ?
Robo:Neural Network is a supervised machine learning algorithm which is inspired by human nervous system and it replicates the similar to how human brain is trained. It consists of Input Layers, Hidden Layers, & Output Layers.
You:yes
Robo:Good to know that
You:explain snowball sampling?
Robo:This technique is used in the situations where the population is completely unknown and rare. Therefore we will take the help from the first element which we select for the population and ask him to recommend other elements who will fit the description of the sample needed. So this referral technique goes on, increasing the size of population like a snowball.For example: Its used in situations of highly sensitive topics like HIV Aids. Not all the victims will respond to the questions asked so researchers can contact people they know or volunteers to get in touch with the victims and collect information

You:what is entropy?
Robo:Sorry I am still learning. Please elaborate or ask other Question!
You:what is cross entropy?
Robo:Cross validation is a model validation technique for evaluating how the outcomes of statistical analysis will generalize to an Independent dataset. Mainly used in backgrounds where the objective is forecast and one wants to estimate how accurately a model will accomplish in practice.
You:no

You:explain quota sampling?
Robo:This type of sampling depends of some pre-set standard. It selects the representative sample from the population. Proportion of characteristics/ trait in sample should be same as population. Elements are selected until exact proportions of certain types of data is obtained or sufficient data in different categories is collected.
You:no
Robo:Sorry I am still learning . I will update myself soon
You:explain convenience sampling?
Robo:Here the samples are selected based on the availability. This method is used when the availability of sample is rare and also costly. So based on the convenience samples are selected. For example: Researchers prefer this during the initial stages of survey research, as its quick and easy to deliver results.
You:yes

You:hi
Robo:Hello, thanks for asking
You:what is svm
Robo:Here we plot each data point in n-dimensional space with the value of each dimension being the value of a particular coordinate. Then, we perform classification by finding the hyper-plane that differentiate the classes very well.
You:yes
Robo:Good to know that
You:what is decision tree classifier
Robo:Decision Tree is a superised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression analysis. It is a tree-like structure in which internal node represents test on an attribute, each branch represents outcome of test and each leafe node represents class label.
You:what is desision tree
Robo:Sorry I am still learning. Please elaborate or ask other Question!
You:what is decisions tree
Robo:A decision tree is a classifier technique based on rules generated with a tree-like graph.A Path from Root node till Leaf node is called as one classification rule
